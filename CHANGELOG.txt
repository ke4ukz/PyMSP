v0.0.1
	Making sure serial monitor thread starts and stops
v0.0.2
	ADD serial port connection functionality
	ADD responses: dictionary of {command, MSPResponse} to keep track of data for a given command's response as well as a flag (finished) to notify when the data has arrived
	ADD responsesTimeout: seconds to wait for a response before giving up
	ADD _sendCommand: sends a command and optional data (adds new item to responses dictionary)
	ADD _waitForResponse: waits for a response for a given command (keeps checking responses dictionary for finished=true)
	ADD _sendAndWait: calls _sendCommand and then _waitForResponse
	ADD _processCommand: adds (or updates) the data for the specified command and sets finished=true
v0.0.3
	ADD __del__: stop the thread and close the serial port when object is deleted
	ADD _toInt16: convert two bytes (bytearray) to a signed word
	ADD _toUInt16: convert two bytes (bytearray) to an unsigned word
	add _toInt32: convert four bytes (bytearray) to a dword
	ADD _toUInt32: convert four bytes (bytearray) to an unsigned dword
	ADD _fromInt16: convert a signed word to two bytes
	ADD _fromUInt16: convert an unsigned word to two bytes
	ADD _fromInt32: convert a signed dword to two bytes
	ADD _fromUInt32: convert an unsigned dword to two bytes
	ADD getAttitude: returns three-axis attitude information
	ADD getIMU: returns raw motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetrometer); some of these may be zero if there isn't such a sensor installed
	ADD getRC: returns RC data (pitch, roll, yaw, throttle, and aux channels)
	ADD getAnalog: returns analog sensor data (battery, rssi)
	ADD getAltitude: returns estimated altitude and vertical speed (only available with an appropriate sensor)
	ADD setRC: set new RC values
	ADD setThrottle: set only throttle to new value
	ADD setAux: set specified Aux channel to new value
v0.0.4
	ADD setHeading: set the follow-heading (not sure what it does...)
	ADD getGPS: get GPS coordinates and other data
	ADD getStatus: get general flight controller status information
v0.0.5
	FIX doesn't try to join with the serial monitor thread if it is not running (that is, if the port open failed)
v0.0.6
	ADD getMotors: returns current motor signal value (not necessarily actual motor speed)
	ADD getBoxnames: returns the BOX names from the flight controller (separated by ';')
	ADD getModeRanges: returns enable range and aux channel for each flight mode
	ADD setAccCalibration: calibrates accelerometer (make sure the copter is on a flat, level surface!)
	ADD setMagCalibration: calibrates the magnetrometer
	ADD getMisc: returns miscellaneous data
	ADD setMisc: sets miscellaneous data
v0.0.7
	ADD DocStrings to public methods
v0.0.8
	FIX spelling of "MSPCOMMANDS" (was MSPCOMMMANDS)
	FIX enum classes are now all private (didn't need to be exposed outside of the class)
	DEL	MSPModeRanges enum class; wasn't needed
v0.0.9
	FIX get* commands now use an intermediate _sendAndGet method to prevent excessive copy-and-paste programming
